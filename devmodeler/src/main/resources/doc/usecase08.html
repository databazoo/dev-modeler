    <h1>UC08. I want to optimize SQL queries</h1>
    <h3>This UC describes how one can optimize application queries (like ones appearing in slowlog). It is assumed a project is already set (See UC01).</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Press “Run SQL queries” hot button at the top of the main window.</li>
        <li>Insert your query into SQL input.</li>
        <li>Press “Explain” or hit “F6” to show operation tree.</li>
        <li>Operation tree shows individual operations as they would be executed on the server.</li>
        <li>Lines connecting operations show the operation load. Thicker lines mean heavier operations.</li>
        <li>Click the operation to show operation details.</li>
        <li>Choose “Data” tab on the right to see the explanation in text mode.</li>
        <li>According to information you find in the explanation, alter your query or add indexes.</li>
        <li>Rerun the explain with “Explain” button or hit “F6”.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><font color="gray">NOTE: availability of operation properties depend on your database type and server version.</font></p>
